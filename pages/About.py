The **WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) Programme** aims to improve access to safe drinking water,
sanitation services, and hygiene practices in vulnerable communities.

As part of quality assurance and accountability mechanisms, **Third Party Monitoring (TPM)** is conducted
to independently assess the implementation, quality, and compliance of WASH interventions.

This Streamlit-based application has been developed to support **TPM field monitoring and reporting**
for UNICEF WASH projects.

The application enables monitors and engineers to:

- Review project information collected during field visits  
- Validate technical progress and compliance  
- Attach and review supporting evidence (photos and audio)  
- Record observations, findings, and recommendations  
- Generate standardized and printable monitoring reports (DOCX format)

st.markdown("""
The WASH TPM Reporting application performs the following core functions:

1. Allows users to select a monitoring **Tool** and **TPM ID**  
2. Loads project and monitoring data from Google Sheets  
3. Displays project details such as location, intervention type, visit date, and implementing partner  
4. Retrieves and previews photo and audio evidence from SurveyCTO attachments  
5. Enables selection of photos for:
   - Cover Page
   - Findings
   - Observations  
6. Supports component-wise documentation of:
   - Observations
   - Major findings (tabular format)
   - Recommendations  
7. Compiles all validated information into a structured **DOCX monitoring report**

**Step 4:** Click **Launch Tool**

**Inside the Tool page:**
- Review and edit general project information  
- Preview and select photo/audio evidence  
- Assign photos to report sections  
- Fill in observations, findings, and recommendations  

**Final Step:**  
Click **Generate DOCX Report** to export the final file.

- If photos/audio don’t load: check your SurveyCTO credentials  
- If TPM ID isn’t found: verify Google Sheet config  
- One valid **cover photo** is required to generate the DOCX report  

**Security Tip:**  
Store SurveyCTO credentials in `secrets.toml` instead of manual entry.
